# Fractals with Tensorflow

This extends the tensorflow tutorial to [create the Mandelbrot Set](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mandelbrot) to create any fractals created with iterative functions.

### Usage
You may change the configurations such as x, y range and the image resolution in the respective python files before running either `python3 makeJulia.py` or `python3 makeMandelbrot.py`.

### Requirements
* Tensorflow
* numpy
* Python Imaging Library
